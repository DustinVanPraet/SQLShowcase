## Improving the SELECT/UPDATE processes in the database to improve testing practices within my position.

### These projects show the growth and changes that were made in the position, as well as myself to become more efficient. Some projects may display some spruced up versions of how we initially assisted the QA team. Then it may show the ways that SQL queries became gradually more complex and overall faster reducing QA wait times by more than 80%. All projects shown are for assisting QA in testing by manipulating the database.
