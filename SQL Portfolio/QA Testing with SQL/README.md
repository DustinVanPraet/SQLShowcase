## Improving the SELECT/UPDATE processes in the database to improve testing practices within my position.

***Disclaimer:*** *All turns, pools, and win_amounts displayed in this project do not accurately reflect the games as played in the field in any way and this data is 
simply used to showcase my SQL skills through Quality Assurance testing purposes.* 

### These projects show the growth and changes that were made in the position, as well as myself to become more efficient. The 1st part of this will display some spruced up versions of how we initially shown to assist the QA team. The 2nd part will show the ways that SQL queries became more complex but overall faster reducing QA wait times by more than 80%. 

### The ideas and concepts here can be referenced and understood throughout all different industries but the scripts themselves are for a very niche role.
