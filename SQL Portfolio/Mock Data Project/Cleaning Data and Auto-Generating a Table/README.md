# This project Auto-Generates a simple customer table using 2 files 

#### One file has first names and one has last names. We clean both files removing any unnecessary information and run a WHILE loop that creates a customer table based on the counter number that was chosen. Each iteration of the loop will generate:
<b>FirstName</b> - Random first name from FirstName table
<br>
<b>LastName</b> - Random last name from LastName table
<br>
<b>MiddleInitial</b> - Random first letter based off all names in the first names list.
<br>
<b>Gender</b> - based off random FirstName chosen.
<br>
<b>Age</b> - Random number between 18 and 100 years old.
<br>
<b>Email</b> - Uses first and last name and a 50% chance to choose between 2 email domains.
