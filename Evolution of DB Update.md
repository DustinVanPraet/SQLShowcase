## This will show the growth and changes that I've made and how the position has become more efficiient
### Scenario:
Within the gambling industry for casino slot machine games, all states have different regualtions and requirements. Some states require a record of every turn played by every machine and this is recorded in a SQL server database for each individual location which may have many different machines that can play many different games. 
<br><br>
In the Quality Assurance(QA) department, all posible multipliers and seeds need to be tested across each individual game to experience and test different features that may not occur but 1 time out of 50,000 turns played. To circumvent this issue while also testing in a Live environment, we will write UPDATE statements to manipulate records to force low chance turns into playing when the terminal reaches out to the database for a turn.
